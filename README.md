# ðŸ©º AI Symptom & Disease Predictor

A web-based AI tool for predicting diseases from patient symptoms and vital information, powered by an ensemble of deep learning (MLP) and Random Forest models, with SHAP explainability.

---

## Features
- **Web-based UI** (Streamlit)
- **Ensemble predictions** (MLP + Random Forest)
- **Top-3 disease predictions**
- **SHAP explainability**: See which features contributed most to the prediction
- **Flexible input**: Patient demographics, vitals, and symptoms with severity

## Setup & Usage

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```

### 2. **Install requirements**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Make sure these files are present:**
- `app.py` (the Streamlit app)
- `symptom_dataset.csv` (your dataset)
- `best_model_symptom_dataset.pth` (MLP model)
- `rf_model_symptom_dataset.pkl` (Random Forest model)
- `scaler_symptom_dataset.pkl`, `ohe_symptom_dataset.pkl`, `label_encoder_symptom_dataset.pkl` (preprocessing objects)

### 4. **Run the app locally**
```
streamlit run app.py
```
Then open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
